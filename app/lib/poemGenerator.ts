  Don't feel obligated to use all the information provided. 
  Sometimes the location name will not be descriptive enough, so you can use the temperature and condition and omit location info.
  Only rely on the location name if it's a notable location.
  Don't use time of day in your haiku.
  Avoid tropes (such as overuse of words like 'Whispers' or 'Gentle'-- be creative! You should incorporate disparate concepts to make something uniquely beautiful).
